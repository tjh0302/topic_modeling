## Probabilistic (Statistical) Approaches - Latent Dirichlet Allocation, LSA

The notebook and python module include implementation of LDA for probabilistic topic modeling on a set of text. 

Visualizations: intertopic distance using pyLDAvis

Functions are built out to visualize the model's topics, examine topics, identify the most probabilistic title, and map topics back to a pandas dataframe.

## Clustering Approaches: K-means, DBSCAN, HDBSCAN

### Implements various techniques for embeddings, dimensionality reduction, and visualization techniques

Dimensionality Reduction: PCA, t-SNE, UMAP
Model Evaluation: Silhouette Score
Topic Extraction: c-TF-IDF (built from scratch), BERTopic (not yet implemented)
Visualizations: 2D scatter plots of dimensionality-reduced clusters (colored), dendrograms (condensed, simple), word cloud (not yet implemented)

## Example data - a small and a large dataset

Large (moderately large) - 2000 documents

Small - Created using ChatGPT my asking it to compile 100 sentences about finance, energy, and education.

## Utilized a virtual environment for dependencies
